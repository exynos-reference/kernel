Exynos PPMU driver
-------------------

Performance events are primitive values used to get performance data. These
events provide information about the behavior of the SoC that can be used
when analyzing system performance. These events are made visible using the
PPMU logic.
Exynos PPMU driver is used by the exynos5 devfreq drivers to control the
bus frequency/voltage.

Required properties:
- compatible: "samsung,exynos5250-int-busfreq", "samsung,exynos5420-int-busfreq"
- reg:
	* physical base address of the PPMUs (e.g DDR, Right Bus, Left bus etc)
	and length of memory mapped region.

Example:
--------

	ppmu {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5250-int-busfreq";
		reg = <0x10C40000 0x2000
		       0x10C50000 0x2000
		       0x10C60000 0x2000
		       0x10CB0000 0x2000
		       0x13660000 0x2000>;
	};
