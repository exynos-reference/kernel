ARM 3D Graphics IP (Mali T6xx)

The Mali T6xx series IP is present in Samsung Exynos
platforms for enabling 3D grahics acceleration.
The DT node for this IP has to be defined in the following
way:

Required properties:

  - compatible : value should be "arm,mali"
  - reg	: Physical base address of the IP registers and
		length of the memory mapped region.
  - interrupts : ARM Mali interrupts to the CPU.
		Three interrupts are needed which are
		1) JOB IRQ number
		2) MMU IRQ number
		3) GPU IRQ number
  - clocks : From common clock binding : handle to g3d clock and aclk_400_g3d
  - clock-names : From common clock binding : Shall be "g3d" and "aclk_400_g3d"

Example :

	mali {
		compatible = "arm,mali";
		reg = <0x11800000 0x5000>;
		interrupts = <0 118 0>, <0 119 0>, <0 117 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 345>, <&clock 346>;
		clock-names = "g3d", "aclk_400_g3d";
	};
