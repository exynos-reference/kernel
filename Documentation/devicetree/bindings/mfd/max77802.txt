Maxim MAX77802 multi-function device

MAX77802 is a Multifunction device with PMIC, RTC and Charger on chip. It is
interfaced to host controller using i2c interface. PMIC, Charger and RTC
submodules are addressed using same i2c slave address.

This document describes the binding for mfd device and PMIC submodule.

Binding for the built-in 32k clock generator block is defined separately
in bindings/clk/maxim,max77802.txt file.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77802";
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Optional node:
- regulators : The regulators of max77802 have to be instantiated
  under subnode named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulator-name {
		standard regulator constraints....
	};
	refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

  The regulator node name should be initialized with a string
to get matched with their hardware counterparts as follow. The valid names are:

	-LDOn 	:	for LDOs, where n can lie in range 1 to 35.
			example: LDO1, LDO2, LDO35.
	-BUCKn 	:	for BUCKs, where n can lie in range 1 to 10.
			example: BUCK1, BUCK5, BUCK10.
Example:

	max77802@09 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77802";
		interrupt-parent = <&wakeup_eint>;
		interrupts = <26 0>;
		reg = <0x09>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;

		regulators {
			ldo11_reg: LDO11 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_ldo11";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1900000>;
				regulator-always-on;
			};

			buck1_reg: BUCK1 {
				regulator-name = "vdd_mif";
				regulator-min-microvolt = <950000>;
				regulator-max-microvolt = <1300000>;
				regulator-always-on;
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
	};
