panel interface for eDP/lvds panels

Required properties:
  - compatible: "panel-lvds"

Optional properties:
	-lcd-en-gpio:
		panel LCD poweron GPIO.
			Indicates which GPIO needs to be powered up as output
			to powerup/enable the switch to the LCD panel.
	-led-en-gpio:
		panel LED enable GPIO.
			Indicates which GPIO needs to be powered up as output
			to enable the backlight.
	-panel-prepare-delay:
		delay value in ms required for panel_prepare process
			Delay in ms needed for the panel LCD unit to
			powerup completely.
			ex: delay needed till eDP panel throws HPD.
			    delay needed so that we cans tart reading edid.
	-panel-enable-delay:
		delay value in ms required for panel_enable process
			Delay in ms needed for the panel backlight/LED unit
			to powerup, and delay needed between video_enable and
			backlight_enable.
	-panel-disable-delay:
		delay value in ms required for panel_disable process
			Delay in ms needed for the panel backlight/LED unit
			powerdown, and delay needed between backlight_disable
			and video_disable.
	-panel-unprepare-delay:
		delay value in ms required for panel_post_disable process
			Delay in ms needed for the panel LCD unit to
			to powerdown completely, and the minimum delay needed
			before powering it on again.
	-panel-width-mm: physical panel width [mm]
	-panel-height-mm: physical panel height [mm]

Example:

	panel-lvds {
		compatible = "panel-lvds";
		led-en-gpio = <&gpx3 0 1>;
		panel-prepare-delay = <40>;
		panel-enable-delay = <20>;
		panel-disable-delay = <20>;
		panel-unprepare-delay = <30>;
		panel-width-mm = <256>;
		panel-height-mm = <144>;
	};
