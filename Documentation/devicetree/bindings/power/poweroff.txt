* Generic Poweroff capability

Power-management integrated circuits or miscellaneous harware components are
sometimes able to control the system power. The device driver associated to these
components might needs to define poweroff capability, which tells to the kernel
how to switch off the system. The corresponding driver must have the standard
property "poweroff-source" in its device node. This property marks the device as
able to shutdown the system. In order to test if this property is found
programmatically, use the helper function "of_system_has_poweroff_source" from
of.h .

Example:

act8846: act8846@5 {
	 compatible = "active-semi,act8846";
	 status = "okay";
	 poweroff-source;
}
